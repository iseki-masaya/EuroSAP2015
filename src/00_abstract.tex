We study the security of Quick UDP Internet Connections
(QUIC for short) -- an experimental transport layer
network protocol recently developed by Google.
Lychev et al.~\cite{LJBN15:QUIC} proposed a new security model,
called Quick ACCE (QACCE), an extension of
authenticated and channel confidentiality establishment (ACCE) model, and
showed that QUIC is secure in the model.
However, they also pointed out some vulnerability on QUIC,
which may increase server loads easily and would possibly cause serious Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
attacks.
In this paper,
we propose a new stronger security model, called
resumable server-only ACCE (RSACCE).
Since the original QUIC does not meet our new security notion,
we propose an enhanced QUIC protocol, without changing the spirit of QUIC, such as
the two-key structure, server-only authentication, no server cash data, repeated usage of server-configuration (SCFG),
and $1$-RTT full and $0$-RTT abbreviate handshakes.
The enhanced QUIC satisfies our strong security requirements under weaker assumptions
and also improves the round complexity.
Here the DDoS attacks mentioned above do not effectively work
against the enhanced QUIC protocol.
