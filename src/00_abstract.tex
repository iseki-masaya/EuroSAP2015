We study the security of Quick UDP Internet Connections
(QUIC for short) -- an experimental transport layer
network protocol recently developed by Google -- and
show some security concern, when abbreviated handshakes,
aka ``resumptions", are established.
To explain our concern, we propose a new security model,
extending server-only authenticated and channel
confidentiality establishment (SACCE), so that
authentication and channel confidentiality can be
evaluated including abbreviated handshake sessions.
We then show that QUIC meets the weaker version of our
security notion, but not the stronger one.
On one hand, QUIC with an optional client encrypted tag
value (CETV) mechanism, satisfies the stronger one.
We finally present a more efficient protocol with the
spirit of QUIC, because QUIC with CETV increases
communication and computational costs.
