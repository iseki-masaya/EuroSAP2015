We proposed a new security model, \textit{resumable} SACCE (RSACCE) security.
We observed that the DDoS attacks appeared in \cite{LJBN15:QUIC} mainly come from 
two vulnerabilities and showed that such vulnerabilities do not appear in a protocol secure in 
the RSACCE model. 
We present an enhanced QUIC protocol, without changing the spirit of QUIC.
The enhanced QUIC satisfies RSACCE security under weaker assumptions and also improves round complexity, 
maintaining $1$-RTT and $0$-RTT connective overhead in the full and abbreviate handshake connections.
The DDoS attacks in \cite{LJBN15:QUIC} do not effectively work against our enhanced QUIC.

The our proposed scheme is similar to TLS 1.3 and the handshake of QUIC will be replaced
TLS 1.3. However, there are another security concern which add a server loads in our
proposed scheme and QUIC + TLS 1.3.
We also suggest the scheme to solve above issue.
