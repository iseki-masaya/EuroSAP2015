We propose a new security model, \textit{Resumable} SACCE (RSACCE) security
to cover the attacks~\cite{LJBN15:QUIC}.
This model consider the security of the initial key $\ik$ in 1-RTT connection
and ensure the consistency of the client between a 1-RTT connection and 0-RTT
connections.
We also propose a new scheme which is more secure and efficient than the original QUIC.
In the our proposed scheme, a client sends its Diffie-Hellman public value in a
first query.

The our proposed scheme is similar to TLS 1.3 and the handshake of QUIC will be replaced
TLS 1.3. However, there are another security concern which add a server loads in our
proposed scheme and QUIC + TLS 1.3.
We also suggest the scheme to solve above issue.
