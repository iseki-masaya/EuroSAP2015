We propose a new security model, \textit{Resumable} SACCE (RSACCE) security and strong RSACCE.
This model consider forward secrecy among all independent sessions.
For resumption to be effective, we compromise but still require
some level of forward secrecy among related resumption sessions.
The original QUIC meets RSACCE security, however it does not meet strong RSACCE security.
Because the adversary can spoof the query in resumption and the server accepts this query.
QUIC has an optional mechanism, called client encrypted tag-value (CETV), which is disabled in the default setting.
If it is enabled, QUIC with CETV satisfies strong RSACCE.
Finally, we presented a more efficient protocol than QUIC, which satisfies strong RSACCE security.
