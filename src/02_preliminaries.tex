We let ${\negl}(\spar)$ to denote an unspecified function $f(\spar)$ such that
$f(\spar) ={\spar}^{-\omega(1)}$, saying that such a function is negligible in $\spar$.
We use the standard notations of digital signature, collision-resistant hash functions, and pseudo random functions.
We also use a stateful symmetric encryption as well as a few known assumptions.
For completeness, we provide their notions given in Appendix~\ref{app:def}.
